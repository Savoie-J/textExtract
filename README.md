# textExtract
Utilizes easyOCR to scrape text data from user selected image.
In order to run this program one would need to be able to successfully utilize easyOCR as an import.
This requires open-cv and pytorch, the latter requires anaconda package manager. 

Common errors can be caused by specific image types, etc. also the quality of the pulled text is naturally flawed at times.
